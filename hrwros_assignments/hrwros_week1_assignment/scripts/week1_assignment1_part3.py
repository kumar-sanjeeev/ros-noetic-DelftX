# Assignment 1 for Week1: In this assignment you will subscribe to the topic
# that publishes sensor information. Then, you will transform the sensor
# reading from the reference frame of the sensor to compute the height of a
# box based on the illustration shown in the assignment document. Then, you
# will publish the box height on a new message type ONLY if the height of the
# box is more than 10cm.

# All necessary python imports go here.

# Copy the code from Part1 here

# Import the correct message type for part 3

    # a python dictionary. And if you don't want to use multiple arguments to
    # the subscriber callback then you can also consider using a Class
    # Implementation like we saw in the action server code illustration.
