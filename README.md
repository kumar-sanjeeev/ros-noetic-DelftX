## ros-noetic-DelftX repository description: 
- **`hrwros`** is the top level folder that contains ros pkgs inside it
- **`hrwros_assignments`** is the another top level folder that contains ros pkgs for weekly based assignments
- **`hrwros_utilities`** is the ros pkgs for useful functions
- **`ros1_course_content`** contains all ros pkgs that I developed during following this course. Basic purpose is to implement all the stuff taught in the     course, to get better understanding of code and also the importance of debugging
